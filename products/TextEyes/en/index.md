## About the App

Text Eyes is an app that extracts text from images. It supports taking photos with the camera, selecting from the photo library, and choosing images from the system share menu.  
This app was developed with users who have visual impairments in mind. It is designed for use with the VoiceOver screen reader and includes automatic reading aloud of extracted text and a feature to copy the text.  
Image recognition is performed on the device, so image data is not provided to third parties. You can use it with confidence.  

## Privacy Policy

1. This application does not collect any personal information from users.
2. The image recognition features provided by this application run on the device. Neither images nor extracted text are provided to any third parties.

## Tips for Use

Text recognition is not perfect. Please understand the appâ€™s characteristics and use it accordingly.

- It is optimized for recognizing horizontally written text. It does not work correctly with vertically written text, such as on book spines.
- It performs best on images where the text is clearly captured, such as documents printed with black text on a white background. It may not recognize text correctly when characters are decorative, such as on food packaging.
- Recognition results may contain missing characters or misrecognized characters.

If you feel the app is not working well, please check the following:

- A correct result is not always guaranteed on the first attempt. If you are using the camera, try moving a little closer to or farther from the subject.
- Text recognition does not function correctly for tilted images or shots taken from an oblique angle. It works best when the text you want to recognize is positioned straight on.
- Repeating recognition many times in a row may degrade quality or result in no text being recognized. Please wait for a short time and try again.
