Thank you for using Swift Eyes, our AI image recognition app. We are pleased to announce that Version 1.3 has been released.

In this version, we have made the following updates:

- You can now configure whether or not to play the camera shutter sound.
- You can now add captions to recognized images and save them in your Photos app.
- We have adjusted the system to remain stable even if the number of users suddenly increases.

We hope Swift Eyes continues to be helpful to everyone.
