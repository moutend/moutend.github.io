Thank you for using the AI image-recognition app, Swift Eyes. We’re pleased to announce the release of **Version 2.0**.

In this update we’ve:

- **Added a sign-in feature.** This lets us resolve any support inquiries more quickly.  
- **Improved processing for unstable internet connections.**  
- **Optimized the app** so you receive image-analysis results even faster.

## Additional Information

To ensure stable operation, signing in is required starting with Version 2.0.

While earlier versions allowed anonymous use, a sign-in is now mandatory to access the app. Image analysis remains **free and unlimited**.

We hope Swift Eyes continues to be a helpful tool for you.
