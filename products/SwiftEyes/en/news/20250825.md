Thank you for using the AI image recognition app, Swift Eyes.  
As stated in the subject, Swift Eyes became unavailable starting around 9:00 PM on August 25, 2025. We apologize for the inconvenience this caused.  
This issue was resolved around 5:00 PM on August 25, 2025, and the service is now operating normally.

## Details of the System Outage

The outage was triggered after we detected a sudden spike in our service operating costs. There was no unauthorized access or other impact on our users, so please rest assured.  
Swift Eyes uses Google Cloud’s Gemini API for image analysis. The root cause of this incident was a malfunction in Google’s billing system. Because fictitious usage charges generated by that malfunction were accumulated and detected as a sudden increase in costs, the system was shut down.  
The issue was resolved around 5:00 PM on August 25, 2025, and we have reported it to Google.
