Posted July 7, 2025

Thank you for using Swift Eyes, our AI image-recognition app. We are pleased to announce the release of version 2.3.

To maintain stable system operations, this update introduces both a free and a paid edition. Their differences are:

* **Free edition:** After every third image analysis, a waiting period is imposed.
* **Paid edition:** Unlimited use with no waiting time.

The waiting-time restriction is the only difference; every other feature remains identical in the free edition.  
For pricing details of the paid edition, please visit the [app homepage](https://moutend.github.io/products/SwiftEyes/en/) or open the app and navigate to **Settings → Subscribe to Premium Plan → Purchase Confirmation**.  
We hope SwiftEye will continue to be helpful to you.
