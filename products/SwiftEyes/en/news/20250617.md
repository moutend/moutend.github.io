Thank you for using the AI image-recognition app, Swift Eyes. We’re pleased to announce the release of **Version 2.1**.

In this update we’ve made:

- Bug fix: Resolved an issue where saving to the Photos app failed after running image analysis with SwiftEye from the share sheet while another app was open on top of SwiftEye.
- Accessibility improvement: VoiceOver now immediately announces “Copied” right after you tap the Copy button in the image-analysis results screen.

We hope Swift Eyes continues to be a helpful tool for you.
