Thank you for using Swift Eyes, our AI image recognition app. We are pleased to announce that Version 1.4 has been released.

In this version, we have made the following updates:

- Two camera types can be selected: standard and silent. With the standard camera, you can use the volume buttons to take pictures.
- Fixed a bug in recognizing and saving large images such as panorama images.

We hope Swift Eyes continues to be helpful to everyone.
