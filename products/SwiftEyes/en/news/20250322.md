Thank you for using the AI image recognition app, Swift Eyes. We are pleased to announce the release of Version 1.2.

This update addresses the delay in image recognition that arose due to an increase in users. The app will update automatically, but you can also manually update it via the App Store.

We hope Swift Eyes continues to be of service to you.
