## About the App

Swift Eyes is an iPhone app designed to assist people with visual impairments. It uses AI to analyze images taken with the camera or shared from apps like Photos, and then communicates the contents as text.  
Because Swift Eyes is optimized for the VoiceOver screen reader, the text is read aloud automatically once the analysis is complete. You can also save the image back to the Photos app with the analysis text embedded as a caption.  
Once analysis is complete, the image data supplied to the AI is promptly deleted and is never provided to any third party. You can use the service with confidence. For details, please refer to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

Note: The AI recognition results provided by this app are for reference only. They do not replace measures to ensure personal safety while moving, medical actions, or similar activities. For details, please review the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

## Pricing

Swift Eyes is available in both free and paid editions. The differences are:

* **Free edition:** After every third image analysis, you will experience a waiting period.
* **Paid edition:** Unlimited image analyses with no waiting time.

The waiting-time restriction is the only difference; all other features are identical. The paid edition is offered as a Premium Plan for $1.99 per month.  
If you enjoy the app, please consider subscribing. You can subscribe at any time by opening the app and selecting **“Subscribe to Premium Plan”** in the settings menu.
