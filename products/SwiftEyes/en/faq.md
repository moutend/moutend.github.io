## Having Trouble?

This page explains how to resolve common issues you may encounter while using Swift Eyes. If the steps here don’t solve your problem, please contact us through the inquiry form at the bottom of the page.

## Q. Sign-in fails

If sign-in fails, please check the following:

- Sign-in will fail if two-factor authentication is not enabled. Follow [Apple’s instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102660) to set it up.
- Child Apple IDs created under Family Sharing cannot be used if the child is under 13 years old.
- Network conditions can cause temporary failures. Wait a few minutes and try signing in again.

## Q. Image analysis fails

Image analysis may fail in the following situations:

1. If no internet connection is available.
2. If the AI refuses to respond due to the image’s content (e.g., sexual or violent images).
3. If the server is busy and the analysis times out. Wait a few minutes and try again.
