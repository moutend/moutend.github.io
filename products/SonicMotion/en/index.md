## About

Sonic Motion is an app that converts the values from the accelerometer, gravity, and rotation sensors into sound in real time. It plays sounds with a soft or hard tone depending on whether the sensor values are positive or negative. Select the motion of the X, Y, or Z axis and experience movement as sound!
