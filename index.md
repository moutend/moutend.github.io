## Profile

Hello, I'm Yoshiyuki Koyanagi. Thank you for visiting my profile page. I'm a full-time software engineer since 2017. My job is designing and implementing web APIs.

FYI, I'm visualy impaired. The modern screen reader, such as VoiceOver on macOS and Narrator on Windows works almost perfect, but some user interfaces are not able to navigate. I prefer email rather than video chat apps.
