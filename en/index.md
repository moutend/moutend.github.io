## Introduction

Thank you for visiting my profile page. I'm Yoshiyuki Koyanagi, a full-time software engineer since 2017. My job is designing and implementing web APIs with Golang.

I'm visually impaired. I can use video calling apps such as Zoom or Google Meet, but I prefer email as a communication tool.
